 An air purifier made from farm waste called Luffa , which is produced when a 'Tori' is dried up .
I was devastated after I read about the properties of the so called 
clean air of Indian cities, it is like smoking 6-7 cigarette a day without consent,
so i started searching for air purifiers , but there was a problem they were really
expensive and I realised there was no way of getting clean for underprivileged people.
So I started brings storming on some ideas for a filter or air purifier and when I was
visiting my family's farm I found out that luffa when prepaid properly could be a filter so I 
started working on it and he is the first filter
